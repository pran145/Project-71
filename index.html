                        <p class="p_modal">Originally from America, I moved to London because I wanted to live abroad but spoke no foreign languages. After a brief and unsuccessful stint as a serving wench at the Tower of London I found work as an actress and comedy performer. I’ve performed at Edinburgh and London comedy festivals. Years ago, when I was touring around the UK as a storyteller I discovered that kids liked, laughed at and didn’t fall asleep when I performed stuff that I wrote myself. I was hooked on writing and performing for kids. Some of my favourite quotes from kids about my storytelling sessions are:

                            “I guess you were a bit better than the rabbits with big heads that were here last week.”
                            “Can I rewind you and watch you again after lunch?”
                            And “How did you know me to put me in your story?”

                            I still live in London, still speak no foreign languages (although I am attempting to learn Italian to wake up my brain a bit) and I still have a sneaking suspicion that the rabbits with the big heads were really better than me but the kid was just being nice.

                            I wrote lots of stories for kids that nobody published but then I wrote “My Big Fat Zombie Goldfish” and Macmillan said that they were hooked. (couldn’t help the fish pun there, sorry). That series has six books and is now published in 11 different languages. Since then I’ve written over 20 books! You can find them all here on my website. 😉

                            Now, I get to tour all over the world talking about books and still making kids laugh.

                            I love to travel, to write, to read, to take long walks, to run a bit but not too much and to spend time with my husband, my kids and my two cats.<br>

                        <p class="p_modal">Jeff Kinney is also the creator of Poptropica, which was named one of Time's 50 Best Websites. He spent his childhood in the Washington, D.C., area and moved to New England in 1995. Jeff lives with his wife and two sons in Massachusetts, where they own a bookstore, An Unlikely Story.Rita Braver talks to the author of the best-selling book in the nation: "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul." It turns out, cartoonist Jeff Kinney's success story is a tale worthy of its own work of fiction.The reason why the original actor wasn't going to be in the movie is because he is 25 years old now, and he doesn't really look like a teenager anymore so the producers just needed another actor that actually looks younger and they found one (that doesn't really look like Rodrick).<br>
